# Image-Captioning-with-Attention-Mechanism
In this project, you will dive into the fascinating world of image captioning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. You will learn how to incorporate the attention mechanism into both the encoder and decoder parts of the network to improve the quality of generated captions.
